# Fork Me Archaeology!
## A Visual Poster Symposium of Script-Reproducible Research for the SAA2016 meeting

Kelsey M. Reese, R. Kyle Bocinsky, and Ben Marwick

### Abstract:

A picture may be worth a thousand words, but the context in which that picture was made tells the true story. Increasingly in data-driven archaeology, the metadata behind an analysis are becoming as important as the results. This poster symposium is based on the notion that a poster, presentation, or publication is an advertisement of a research finding or analytical method—true scientific contributions include the production of raw data and the process of analyzing and interpreting them. Often, the best way to capture the nuances of an analysis is through a script, or computer code. A script is both reproducible (allowing for the methods to be thoroughly scrutinized and re-actualized) and portable (potentially allowing an analysis to be applied to other culture-contexts). Reproducibility and portability are enhanced by using free and open-source software (FOSS) for data analysis.
All analyses presented in this poster session have been scripted for reproducibility and portability, and all use FOSS tools. These posters emphasize data-driven visual storytelling—>50% of their area are eye-catching visualizations, and each is limited to 500 words of text. PDFs of all posters and the metadata, code, and documentation for all analyses are available at https://github.com/FOSS4Arch/SAA2016.


## Here are the instructions for preparing your poster for this symposium (they're a bit different from the usual stuff, so please read carefully!)
-	Be as creative as you want! Tell a story with your visuals…. make them striking, intriguing, stimulating, and awe-inspiring!
-	Try for >50% of the area of the poster to consist of eye-catching visual displays of data (banish the 3D pie chart!).
-	Maximum of 500 words, including intro/conclusions and figure captions (not including title/authors/institutions, labels within figures, citations, and acknowledgments).
-	We want these posters to be true knowledge contributions—no trivial little showy pieces! Make the poster about your data and findings, and not about the methods (your well-documented code will hopefully speak for itself). As with most SAA presentations, please have this research be working towards publication, if not already published. 
-	All analyses use only free and open-source software (especially for GIS analyses).
-	Include logos of all software used in the analyses (i.e., GitHub, GRASS, R, etc.). This will help others discover new tools that might be suitable for their research.
-	Big posters are better, as the SAA gives you a 4x8 space to fill. Try 72 x 42 inches (6 x 3.5 feet).
-	Create a GitHub account (if you don’t already have one) and post your code to the symposium’s GitHub repository: https://github.com/FOSS4Arch/SAA2016. (We’ll create a folder for you when you submit an abstract). We will also ask you to post a PDF of your poster alongside your code as we get closer to the SAAs.
-	Include the URL for your GitHub folder prominently on the poster, so people can find it. For some 2008 flair, add a QR Code.

Please don't hesitate to contact us with any questions or if you need help with your software/scripts/visualisations/poster/etc.
